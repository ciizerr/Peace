## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio (Ladybug/2025 version recommended)
- Android device or emulator running Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher
- A Google Gemini API Key (for AI features)

    ```
    *Alternatively, you can input the key directly in the app settings via the "BYOK" feature.*
