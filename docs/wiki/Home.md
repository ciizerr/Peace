# Welcome to the official developer handbook for Peace!

Peace is a personalized daily assistant designed to shift task management from a stressful burden to a rewarding, calm experience. We use modern Android development and Google's Gemini AI to achieve "Calm Engagement."

**Current Status:** The project is in v2.0 (Alpha) development. The core UI, AI integration, and user settings are complete. We are currently implementing the Room Database persistence layer.

**Next Milestone:** Replace all dummy data with live, persistent task lists.
